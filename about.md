My name is Gabriel and I'm trying to get a job as a Software Engineer.

My goal this year is to make low quality and funny blogposts instead of mouthing off on Discord. I am a Gamer so this blog is the only way I have to contribute to society using my Hobby.

If there's one thing that you should know about me it's that if you're ever not sure if I'm being fascetious, I am. Also all spelling/punctuation/grammar mistakes are an intentional, artistic choice rather than some sort of error.

I would love to hear your thoughts, so message me at Redless#6817 on Discord, or email me at brookmangabriel at gmail dot com.
