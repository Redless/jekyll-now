*People don't want to get screwed over. Only if someone truly believes that their sacrifices will not be in vain, will they produce their best work.*

### I

"Golden Balls" was a UK game show that ran in the late 00's. It's well known for the prisoner's dilemma that constituted its double blind final round. Each contestant could choose to "split", dividing the prize pool between the two contestants. However, a contestant could also choose to "steal", taking the entire prize pool for themselves (but if both people picked "steal", each of them went home with nothing.

Before they made their choices, the contestants could talk to one another, and inevitably, each of them would try to convince the other that they were surely going to split. In practice, however, stealing was extremely common, to everyone's detriment. That is, until a contestant named Nick Corrigan split the game wide open:

According to his RadioLab interview, Nick's unique strategy was a result of a sudden realization that he had one day while swimming. The realization is as follows: it's not the hope of taking home all the money that causes people to play defect, it's the fear of their opponent taking home all the money and them getting none. People are afraid that they will make a sacrifice that will end in futility.

In "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother", Amy Chua explains how she raised her children to be successful at music and academics using traditional chinese methods. From chapter 6, "The Virtuous Circle":

“If done properly, the Chinese strategy produces a virtuous circle. Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America. Once a child starts to excel at something—whether it’s math, piano, pitching, or ballet—he or she gets praise, admiration, and satisfaction. This builds confidence and makes the once not-fun activity fun. This in turn makes it easier for the parent to get the child to work even more.”
Amy Chua teaches this to her children: if they put in hard work -> success -> recognition. This fuels more hard work in a "virtuous circle".

Hard work leads to results, results lead to praise, and praise leads to hard work. For someone to make a big sacrifice to acheive an end, then, we require the assurance that 1. Their sacrifice will pay off, and 2. That people will appreciate whatever they produce. This is because everyone's greatest fear is that they will follow the rules and make the sacrifice that they think appropriate, only to realize too late that there is no social status to be gained by doing so.

(When I say sacrifice, I'm referring to the process of giving up instant gratification for a future reward.)

In the case of the contestants on "Golden Balls", there was substantial uncertainty about whether or not a sacrifice, in the form of playing "split", would pay off, which resulted in the sacrifice not being made.

Take advantage of the fear of a futile sacrifice when motivating yourself: explicitly think about what would happen if your sacrifices were futile when making your plans. By exploring the outcomes of getting screwed, you disarm the instinctive fear reaction that you have when you leave them in the dark.

You can also unlink your "commitment to making a sacrifice" from your "belief the sacrifice will turn out well". For example, certain moral systems would say that choosing "steal" in the Golden Balls is wrong no matter how likely you think you are to get screwed over. If you adhere to such a moral system, you can have the courage to make the sacrifice independantly of the possibility of futility.

Take advantage of the fear of a futile sacrifice when dealing with others: if you guarantee to them that there is some reward to be had if only they make their sacrifice, they are far more likely to make it. As Nietzche said, those who have a why can bear any how. And remember that if they believe there is a possibility that they will get screwed over, they are unlikely to try their hardest and give it all they've got.

### But what if the fear is valid?

In modern society, there are a lot of institutions that are explicitly set up to guarantee that sacrifices will pay off, for example, going to college to study computer science instead of getting a job straight out of high school will almost surely lead to better job prospects down the road. Also, well-adjusted people will usually reciprocate sincere kindness towards them. Of course, not everyone is well-adjusted, and not every major is computer science, but, in general, if something seems like a safe sacrifice to make, it is.

In addition, not every unsafe sacrifice is bad. There are potentially futile sacrfices that it's still in your best interest to make. In this case, I advocate for anticipating what will happen if your sacrifice is futile: often, you will find that the bad result isn't as bad as you might've thought. If you still find the potential for a futile sacrifice to be terrifying, you can consider adopting the belief that a futile sacrifice is impossible anyhow. [It may not be true, but it still might be the most useful belief to have.](https://brianlui.dog/2018/03/20/useful-models-are-better-than-correct-models/)

If you do choose to make unsafe sacrifices, you should be very careful, since the downside of wildly making futile sacrifices can be high.
