title: Big Bear Buyout Released!
---

I've been working on a game in my spare time for the past 4 months. Today I finished the first version, which you can hopefully download [here][redless.github.io/downloads/Big-Bear-Buyout-v1.zip]. Below I've laid out the rules.

Each turn, you'll get a group of 3 bears and a rabbit, and you have to choose where to place them in order to surround the rabbits with the bears. You can rotate the pieces with z and c.

Every rabbit cleared this way adds to your score. On the right side of the screen, you'll see your current point total and three point benchmarks. Passing the first and second benchmarks will add more seats for the animals, and passing the third is the win condition.

When one of the rabbits is placed on the edge, it acts like a bear and can't be cleared that round. Other than that, you can clear any number of rabbits as long as there are no exposed edges, like in Go.

There's also a timer that starts at 8 seconds and increases by 5 seconds every time a piece is placed. If the timer runs out, you'll lose a point.

The game is over once you can no longer fit any more groups of animals on the board.

### What I want from you

I'm not done with this game. Here is some feedback I'm specifically looking for:

1. Does the game feel equally difficult when a lot of bears and rabbits spawn rather than a few?

2. Is each phase (8x8, 12x12, and 16x16) equally difficult?

3. Are the starting ranking levels appropriate places to start, in your opinion?

I appreciate your helping me with this game. I hope that you enjoy the game, and feel free to tell me what you think at the [Dinofarm Discord](https://discord.gg/8PPwfDY) or [Dinofarm Forums](http://www.dinofarmgames.com/forum/index.php).
