*The best controller feature that no one is selling. Why is it good and why aren't they selling it?*

## Open the gates!

On gamepads there's usually a circular hole in the plastic that the control stick extends through. However, this hole doesn't necessarily have to be perfectly circular. It can have notches at specific angles which allow you to press the stick at those angles very consistently. The most well-known controller like this is the gamecube controller, which has "octagonal gates" which let you easily hit any of the four cardinal directions or the four diagonal midpoints between them.

## Why they help

I was playing smash recently on my 8bitdo SN30pro+ since I left my gamecube controllers at home, and whenever I'd do a right-facing uptilt I'd turn around first. Also I would sometimes input an up-B at a shallow angle and wind up doing a side-B instead, but only when moving right. I realized that this is because the directions that I input on the sticks are rotated slightly from perfectly cardinal. For example the left stick, when I input down I input slightly left, when I input left, I input slightly up, etc. (reverse on the right stick). I think this is because my thumbs extend from further up the controller, and when I move right, for example, I just extend my thumb. I hit the cardinal directions perfectly when I'm playing on a gated controller, since I push the stick all the way into the notch.

## Two concrete non-smashlike examples

In Mario Kart Wii there are multiple angles that you can turn your bike depending on how far you push the stick to the side. How far you push the stick also determines how fast you charge your mini-turbo, which is a boost that you get by drifting. The steeper the stick angle, the harder the turn, and also the faster the mini-turbo charges. There's a certain stick angle that's super advantageous because it lets you turn relatively shallowly (very important for certain courses) while still charging your mini-turbo at near the max rate, netting the best of both worlds. This angle is not easy to consistently hit usually, but if you're playing on the nunchuck, gamecube controller, or pro controller, you can use any of the four diagonal notches on the octagonal gate to hit this angle consistently with little to no effort. Wow!

In one of the Super Monkey Ball games (the second one?), speedrunners use a strategy which requires extremely precise stick angles to execute. This strat would not be speedrun viable except for the fact that the one of the notches on the gamecube's octagonal gate is just such an angle. By holding the stick in that notch at the start of the level, speedrunners can execute the difficult strat with high consistency.

## Why (maybe)?

After the gamecube and wii became obsolete, nintendo gave up on putting octagonal gates on their controllers. I guess they thought that the controllers looked more modern if the stick gates were smooth and circular? The other game companies, despite their usual more-conservative-than-nintendo takes on controllers, had never used them at all (?). So gated controllers became a thing of the past, that only retro game fans and smash players remember and love.

## What can we do?!?!

The only controllers you can buy these days that have octagonal gates are gamecube controllers and imitation gamecube controllers. So if you want octo-gates you need to also put up with the gamecube button layout, gamecube dpad, gamecube triggers, gamecube form factor, and the gamecube stick layout (left stick above dpad). Two of these things unambiguously suck and the other three are a matter of preference, a preference you might not be able to satisfy if you want the octo-gates.

If you get a fightstick you can easily get whatever gates you want (in fact, I don't even know if they make fightsticks without gates). But if you want a non-gamecube-style controller with gated sticks you have to hire a 3rd party service to take your controller shell and file it down (or do it yourself?) which is like fifty bucks (seriously) and/or time intensive. I know that some competetive smash ultimate players who play on the switch pro controller have done this because it's so important for their game. I guess it's worth it if you're SUPER serious and/or rich.

I think my golden dream in this arena is that 3rd party controller companies (8bitdo is the only one I trust, though) would sell controllers (or shells for their existing controllers) with octagonal gates. If 8bitdo sold either of those things I'd buy them immediately. Probably not going to happen though.
