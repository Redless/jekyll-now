*Everyone loves a good metroidvania, but we love some metroidvanias more than others. This post is my attempt to explain why and also give some concrete recommendations for metroidvanias I like.*

## The core conflict in a metroidvania

The core conflict in a metroidvania is that the map is difficult to navigate. When you want to go from point A to point B you don't know how to get there. You don't know if you can get there right now, or if you need to go somewhere else first. Sometimes you don't even know where point B is, so you're just exploring the map without an explicit goal.

This is obviously compelling to anyone who has ever liked mazes. When I was a kid I refused to learn how to use a pen or pencil until my parents bought me a book of mazes, and then I taught myself the pencil because I had to use it to complete the book. If you don't understand this, then I don't know what to tell you. A metroidvania is even better than a normal maze because it features context besides the simple spatial location of the character, namely the upgrades that they have at the time.

## Constructing a map that's difficult to navigate

The easiest way to navigate through a map is by walking in a straight line in the direction that you want to go. To keep the player from being able to do this a metroidvania needs to put tons of walls. You can also put gravity into the game because that makes it so that a sufficiently large vertical distance also automatically acts as a wall.

Ideally once you have enough walls your map should switch from being best represented as a "grid" (like an open space or field) to a "graph" (like a bunch of rooms with corridors connecting them). Google "computer science" to find out more. Incidentally this is what keeps the 2D Zelda games from working as metroidvanias: the overworlds in those games are grids and wide open fields and absolutely not corridors at all and you can walk in a straight line on them easily. The dungeons in those games are sufficiently labyrinthine and if the games were only dungeons they would be metroidvanias.

Another thing that makes maps more interesting to navigate is branching paths. The important decision that comes with navigating is when you have to choose which place to go. They also prevent the player from getting stuck because if you can't figure out how to progress down one path then there are always others, mitigating the worst downside of making hard to navigate maps. If you don't have at least some branching paths then you'll end up with a Luigi's Mansion style map, which would be hard to navigate except that the navigation puzzle always has exactly one right answer.

The final component to making a map difficult to navigate is to create factors that change how the map can be navigated independently of the player's position on it. This can take the form of environmental factors such as the water level in Ocarina of Time's water temple, but more often than not it takes the form of a permanent powerup that gives the player a new movement or navigation option. The powerups recontextualize the map and change which parts of it are accessible. The ideal powerup should do this in an interesting or unpredictable way, such as the ice beam in Super Metroid. If you didn't know you were going to get this item you'd just see the enemies as existing to slow the player's progress, but with the ice beam, all the enemies become possible stepping stones as well, completely changing how you see the game in a way that you couldn't predict before getting the powerup.

## Constructing a map that's rewarding to navigate

These powerups also give the player feeling of progression over time, and importantly this progression is a function of exploring and navigating the map (if the powerups are scattered across the map to be discovered by the player). Thus, the powerups provide an empetus that encourages the player to explore more.

There should also be tons of bonus stuff to sightsee.

Side-rewards like e-tanks. how cna we make themnot suck?

## Micro-level navigation

Combat/platforming exist to fill time

Sucks they have to be there, but otherwise navigation feedback would be too fast, destroying tension

## The atmosphere

Another key trait of metroidvanias is that they should sell their conflict on a thematic level as well. It might be difficult to get to the bathroom in some guy's house you're at for a party but that doesn't work well as a metroidvania. Aloneness and hostile environment.

## The best metroidvanias

Here are my explicit recommendations and thoughts on notable works in the genre.

### Super metroid and other 2D metroids

These games creat

### Metroid Prime and its sequels

Prime 1's first key idea is that labyrinthine maps are even better in 3D. That's super true and this game spends its entire runtime showing exactly how true it is. Prime 1's second key idea is the "scan visor" which is a tool that you get that lets you scan objects in your environment. This is one of the most powerful constructs for emergent/natural storytelling that I can think of, and it makes exploration feel extremely worthwhile since you are always scanning new things to learn more about the world. It makes the whole planet feel alive while also feeling like such a natural part of the power suit that it does a ton of immersion work. Prime 1 also features some rather devilish puzzles and hidden items, which you can get whenever you want but which you only obtain clues for later in the game. It feels amazing to uncover one of these items on your own, and having to traverse the whole map to find them after you get the clues is cool too. Prime 1 is probably the best Metroid game in my opinion.

Prime 2 kept what most of made its predecessor good, while adding an additional 4th dimension which amplifies the map navigation difficulty (awesome). I like and approve of 90% of this game. The remaining ten percent is mostly morph ball puzzles and boss fights. Seriously, someone who worked on this game had a huge hard on for morph ball movement and fighting, which is unfortunate because it totally sucks. At its best the morph ball sections are excessive and shoehorned in, but at their worst they are legitimately difficult (frustrating) and time consuming, especially on the wii version where the "shake the wii remote to jump" control finally reveals itself as a terrible thing to exist in any situation that requires speed or precision. There are a few other issues such as some bottlenecks and places where I got stuck and didn't know where to go next, and the puzzle bosses are even worse than before. I cannot recommend this game in good faith for those reasons.

Prime 3 forces you to use the motion controls to open doors, and it has a shitton of characters and plot elements that it introduces before setting you loose in the world. It takes at least 90 minutes to introduce all this stuff and otherwise waste your time, and that's when I stopped playing.

### Castlevania series

The Castlevania series has seriously amazing music and atmosphere, as well as some of the best map design around. The thing that sucks about this series is the fact that these games feel the need to shoehorn in those blasted "RPG elements" by making the player collect gear and weapons and equipment and sometimes even "level up". Imagine shifting focus on the interesting pars of the game and making it about numers instead. Couldn't be me. Couldn't even be good. And it isn't.

I like Harmony of Dissonance the best since it has the least RPG elements and most interesting movement. My second favorite is Aria of Sorrow which is probably the best of the more RPG-y and it has very little chaff. I have bounced off of Symphony of the Night at least twice.

### Hollow Knight

This game has a lot of freedom and you can do things in many different orders, which ensures that you never feel stuff and always are excited to keep exploring. The assets and combat are also amazing (a first for the genre?). Therefore, it's the best metroidvania.

### Environmental Station Alpha

### Toki Tori 2

This metroidvania is unique, because instead of powerups, it just has puzzles. Like in any puzzle game, solving easier puzzles forces you to have insights that you will also need to apply when solving harder puzzles. Thus, solving a certain puzzle somewhere on the map will effectively make another puzzle elsewhere solvable. Also, some puzzles don't even look like puzzles until you learn a key mechanic from another puzzle explicitly. I highly recommend this game from a mechanical standpoint.

### Other Ones

There were some other ones I liked (but not enough to put on this list), such as Axiom Verge, and a bunch more that I'm still playing, such as La Mulana. If one of them really kicks ass then I'll throw it on here as I see fit.
