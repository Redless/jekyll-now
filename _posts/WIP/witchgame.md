*The Witch's Game is a choose-your-own-adventure story about a guy who fights a witch in a mansion for 1 year. What's the best way to beat the witch?*

## What is it?

For those who don't know, a choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) is an image with a bunch of text on it that asks you to imagine yourself in a strange situation and then asks you questions about how you'd handle it. For years, cretins on the internet have been making these things and reading them, including me. You can find some fresh ones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/). You can think of a CYOA as like a story in that it has characters and setting but it doesn't usually have a linear plot since the player is supposed to fill in the details based on the choices they made while reading it. The best CYOAs should evoke a strong atmosphere and ask the player to make interesting choices. One genre of CYOA is when the choices revolve around fighting some entity or group of entities, and that's what The Witch's Game is about.

To summarize, there's a witch who has all sorts of magical powers and she has to kill one person every year in a ritualized death game in order to keep them. This year that person is you. You are given a gigantic mansion with tons of secret passageways, and every night the witch will enter the mansion at sundown and try to kill you before the clock strikes twelve. During the game her powers are disabled, except for a few that you pick for her. You can also pick modifiers for your mansion and pick a magical weapon or tool to bring with you. If you survive the full year then the witch dies and you get a reward from the beings who gave the witch her powers.

Here is the CYOA in full.

## Why am I writing this?

I think The Witch's Game is the best "conflict centric" CYOA I've encountered and maybe the best CYOA in general. Since I discovered it like six months ago I've been thinking about it and talking about it with different groups of friends. This is my attempt to chroniclize those thoughts and conversations by explaining that the conclusions I've come to about which strategies are good.

# The Strategies

Let's dive into a few different genres of strategies for fighting the witch.

## Rush Her Down

One obvious strategy is to meet the witch as she's entering the mansion and kill her immediately. If you do the killing with the rune dagger you can lock the witch out of the mansion for a month. Then, you can kill her the same way 11 more times and the year is over.

There are a few reasons that this strategy looks good. I think the most obvious one is the fact that with only a few moments each month spent confronting the witch, there are a lot fewer variables and much less time for unexpected things to happen. Also, there are several powers such as regeneration, charm, and voodoo doll that are literally completely useless in a fight, and even some of the stronger powers could plausibly be disabled before she can use them, since the dagger prevents her from using magic.

Furthermore, the player is granted their optimal physical form upon entering the mansion while the witch is a normal sized woman. Therefore, maybe you can pick an extremely physically capable form and demolish the witch with ease. If you picked the companion then suddently the fight is a 2 against 1 situation, even easier for you to win.

Another unconventional strategy for this route is to make the witch take the clone power. When her magic is disabled by the rune dagger, she will arguably be forced to reabsorb her clone, stunning her for several minutes and making it easy for the player to convert a scratch from the dagger into a kill. Depending on how you interpret the rules this could be really powerful! The witch can disable her clone ability which prevents this strategy from working, but it means you can force the witch to take this ability with no effect on you.

However, the rushdown strategy sucks. One of the most important yet innocuous seeming lines in the CYOA is "With the defeat of her previous opponent, she has almost reached her goal." This line implies that the witch has won nearly a hundred death games before this one. Do you really think that the witch can be taken on in a straightforward fistfight? She has probably had to fight dozens of people many, many times in her previous deathgames. She has probably spent her century of life becoming an extremely capable hand to hand combatant. Why shouldn't she? She knows she will have to fight constantly, and she has powers that allow her to slow time and make clones of herself, greatly expediting the speed at which she can get better at fighting. So, she is very good at fighting. Even if you have a dagger. Even if you're twice her size. Even if there are two of you. You cannot fight her and hope to win.

## Nope on out

You may have noticed that the above logic can be applied to many skills besides fighting. Any skill the she is likely to use in the deathgames, the witch will surely have put a lot of time and effort into. Tactics, tracking, stealth, climbing, sense of direction, tool making, psychology, and noticing key details about her environment are skills it is safe to assume she is adept at, and they're just a drop in the ocean. If we knew the parameters of the previous death games (exactly like this one but with a different setting? Different rules? Completely different?) we could learn a lot more about which skills in particular, but assuming this game is representative of the group as a whole, things don't look good.

Luckily there's a strategy that makes use of ths insight. Namely, refusing to play in the witch's game. This strategy is obviously extremely powerful, but if you choose it you won't get a reward. Could the rewards possibly be worth playing in the game?

Well, there is some probability that you will win the game. If you pick one hiding spot and never leave, maybe the witch doesn't find it for a whole year and you just happen to win by default, to name a simple baseline strategy that CAN win, however unlikely. And if this happens the payoff is enormous. "Biological immortality" stands out to me as a reward that I'd be willing to take a high chance of death to acheive (at least 80%, possibly orders of magnitude higher). Infamously, I think that immortality would be cool and sick as hell and wouldn't suck at all, an opinion which everyone but me inexplicably disagrees with. If you follow my opinion there then maybe it's worth taking on the high chance of death for a small chance of living forever. Maybe you feel similarly towards one of the other rewards (all the rewards are extremely strong in their own right from what I can tell).

I'm just going to assume that the player likes the rewards enough to eat the high chance of death. If I didn't then this post would be a lot shorter. So how do you triumph over these insturmountable odds?

## Hide and Seek

If the witch is close to you and she knows it she will fight you and win. If you run she will chase you, and she's better at chasing than you are at running. So, in order to survive you will need to evade and hide from the witch. Luckily, you have a giant mansion in which to do so.

If you're hiding from the witch, what are the best items you can bring with you to allow you to evade her?
