*The Witch's Game is a choose-your-own-adventure story about a guy who fights a witch in a mansion for 1 year. What's the best way to beat the witch?*

## What is it?

For those who don't know, a choose-your-own-adventure (CYOA) is an image with a bunch of text on it that asks you to imagine yourself in a strange situation and then asks you questions about how you'd handle it. For years, cretins on the internet have been making these things and reading them, including me. You can find some fresh ones [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/makeyourchoice/). You can think of a CYOA as like a story in that it has characters and setting but it doesn't usually have a linear plot since the player is supposed to fill in the details based on the choices they made while reading it. The best CYOAs should evoke a strong atmosphere and ask the player to make interesting choices. One genre of CYOA is when the choices revolve around fighting some entity or group of entities, and that's what The Witch's Game is about.

To summarize, there's a witch who has all sorts of magical powers and she has to kill one person every year in a ritualized death game in order to keep them. This year that person is you. You are given a gigantic mansion with tons of secret passageways, and every night the witch will enter the mansion at sundown and try to kill you before the clock strikes twelve. During the game her powers are disabled, except for a few that you pick for her. You can also pick modifiers for your mansion and pick a magical weapon or tool to bring with you. If you survive the full year then the witch dies and you get a reward from the beings who gave the witch her powers.

Here is the CYOA in full.

## Why am I writing this?

I think The Witch's Game is the best "conflict centric" CYOA I've encountered and maybe the best CYOA in general. Since I discovered it like six months ago I've been thinking about it and talking about it with different groups of friends. This is my attempt to chroniclize those thoughts and conversations by explaining that the conclusions I've come to about which strategies are good.
