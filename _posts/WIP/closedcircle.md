## What it is

A closed circle mystery is a story where the characters are all trapped in the same place together. Mysterious, dangerous, and confusing stuff starts happening and they can't escape it. Then there are a series of twists which explain the mysteries in a satisfying way. The most well-known example is Agatha Christie's "And Then There Were None". I read about a billion of these during the coronatine and I'm going to inflict on you all some posts about what I think of each one, but first I need to establish why this genre is good at all and what criteria I look for from a story in it.

## Monster in the House

Legendary screenwriter Blake Snyder talks about the "Monster in the House" plot as one of the ten fundamental plots that all stories are built upon. He says that it's the most primal of these plots since it deals with physical danger and being hunted, which are things that humans are universally afraid of. The basic idea is that there's a dangerous "monster" that threatens the characters and goes after them and they have to hide from it or fight it or whatever. They can't just run away because they are stuck in the "house" where the monster is, for some reason. This leads to constant tension because the characters are in danger and so there's a lot of pressure to solve the problem of the monster. This heightened **tension** is the first component of what makes this genre so compelling. By the way, this tension is also what sets the genre apart from a traditional "golden age" mystery: in those books the crime usually happened in the past, and the detective is never in any physical danger. #yeah but are those books really not tense? its really the danger and threat that sets them apart

Snyder says that to write an effective "Monster in the House" story, the most important decisions are choosing a monster, and choosing a house. So let's talk about the choice of monster.

## The Real Monster is the Friends We Made Along the Way

Closed circle mysteries supply a monster by using the other characters in the story. The bad stuff that's happening could have a human culprit, and maybe that culprit is hiding amogus. That's a monster. The characters know this too which leads to them mistrusting one another and then acting adversarially against each other because of that mistrust. That's a monster. Maybe someone in the group has a personal secret that they can't reveal but which is driving them to behave in unpredictable ways that aren't always aligned with the benefit of the group, which creates even more mistrust. That's a monster. On the other hand, maybe one of the people who doesn't trust them is actually the real culprit after all, and is just trying to frame someone else to drive a wedge between the rest of the group. That's a monster too.

The common theme here is **mistrust**. We wish that we could all work together, but as long as someone is hiding something, no one can be trusted. Don't forget that the worst kind of mistrust is the kind that turns out to be right.

## It's a mystery to us all

This monster is extra interesting because its exact nature (identity, motivations, etc.) is a **mystery** for most of the story. So, the player must come up with their own theories and ideas about what is going on based on what they witness in the story and their "reads" and feelings about different characters, like in a social deduction game (e.g. mafia or werewolf or avalon or secret hitler). Unlike a traditional social deduction game, though, a closed circle mystery was carefully and centrally designed rather than emerging organically from a set of rules, so it's usually more interesting.

Once the author knows that the reader is going to be mistrusting characters and cooking up theories, they can start to leave foreshadowing that points towards one explanation or another which the reader can pick up on and incorporate into their own ideas about what is happening, just like in any mystery. The author can play with the reader's expectations by foreshadowing one thing and delivering another (that was also foreshadowed, in retrospect). The best thing possible, of course, is when the payoff of the mystery is utterly unexpected and outlandish, yet makes perfect sense in the context of the rest of the story.

## Reviewing system

In this post I established the four main components of what makes this genre good, namely tension, mistrust, mystery, and twists. In the future when I review a bunch of closed circle mysteries I'm going to use these terms a lot so look out for them.

In addition to those criteria I'll also evaluate the stories based on normal, universal story stuff. I mean things like the quality of the prose, the pacing, how much I rooted for the characters, and stuff. I'm also going to evaluate things like the graphics and music because (spoiler alert) most works in this genre are visual novels (link).

I rate stuff on an improved ten point system (explanation).

I'm not going to rate stuff unless I'm long done with it, which is good for XYZ reason.

Thanks for reading this and be on the lookout for my first review sometime in the next month!
