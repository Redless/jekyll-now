*People don't want to get screwed over. Only if someone truly believes that their sacrifices will not be in vain, will they give their all to the task at hand.*

"Golden Balls" was a UK game show that ran in the late 00's. It's well known for the prisoner's dilemma that constituted its double blind final round. Each contestant could choose to "split", dividing the prize pool between the two contestants. However, a contestant could also choose to "steal", taking the entire prize pool for themselves. However, if both people picked "steal", each of them went home with nothing.

Before they made their choices, the contestants could talk to one another, and inevitably, each of them would try to convince the other that they were surely going to split. In practice, however, stealing was extremely common, to everyone's detriment. That is, until a contestant named Nick Corrigan split the game wide open:

According to his RadioLab interview, Nick's unique strategy was a result of a sudden realization that he had one day while swimming. The realization is as follows: it's not the hope of taking home all the money that causes people to play "steal", it's the fear of their opponent screwing them over and leaving them with nothing. When negotiating with other people or with future or pasts versions of onesself, it's crucial, more than anything else, to remove this fear of someone's sacrifices for a cause being in vain.

In "Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother", Amy Chua explains how she raised her children to be successful at music and academics using traditional chinese methods. From chapter 6, "The Virtuous Circle":

“If done properly, the Chinese strategy produces a virtuous circle. Tenacious practice, practice, practice is crucial for excellence; rote repetition is underrated in America. Once a child starts to excel at something—whether it’s math, piano, pitching, or ballet—he or she gets praise, admiration, and satisfaction. This builds confidence and makes the once not-fun activity fun. This in turn makes it easier for the parent to get the child to work even more.”
Amy Chua teaches this to her children: if they put in hard work -> success -> recognition. This fuels more hard work in a "virtuous circle".

Hard work leads to results, results lead to recognition, and recognition leads to hard work. If a person believes that it's possible, or even likely, that the result of hard work will be ignored, motivation for performing that work in the first place will evaporate. Instilling in her children a sense that diligent practice _will_ lead to hard work if done properly is the biggest upside of Chua's style of parenting, even more than the accomplishments themselves.

As Chua makes clear, there are two requirements for that attitude. 1) Hard work towards a goal will lead to mastery, and 2. That other people will bestow social status as a result of that mastery.

Other sacrifices, such as the trust required to pick "split" on "Golden Balls" work the same way. A person will not make them unless they are sure that they will get something valuable in return. In the case of the contestants on "Golden Balls", there was substantial uncertainty about whether or not a sacrifice, in the form of playing "split", would pay off, which resulted in the sacrifice not being made.

Take advantage of the fear of a futile sacrifice when motivating yourself: explicitly think about what would happen if your sacrifices didn't pay off when making your plans. If you know what will happen if you get screwed, you can disarm the instinctive fear reaction.

You can also unlink your "commitment to making a sacrifice" from your "belief the sacrifice will turn out well". For example, certain moral systems would say that choosing "steal" in the Golden Balls is wrong no matter how likely you think you are to get screwed over. If you adhere to such a moral system, you can have the courage to make the sacrifice independantly of the possibility of futility.

Take advantage of the fear of a futile sacrifice when dealing with others: if you convince them that their sacrifice will pay off, they are far more likely to make it. As Nietzche said, those who have a why can bear any how. Make sure that you address both the possibility of failure at the task itself, and failure to be recognized for it.

### But what if the fear is valid?

In modern society, there are a lot of institutions that are explicitly set up to guarantee that sacrifices will pay off. For example, going to college to study computer science instead of getting a job straight out of high school will almost surely lead to better job prospects down the road in spite of the lower income in the short term. Sacrifices made to your future are not the only kind that are set up to pay off, either; well-adjusted people will usually reciprocate sincere kindness towards them.

In addition, not every unsafe sacrifice is bad. There are potentially futile sacrfices that it's still in your best interest to make. In this case, you can consider adopting the belief that a futile sacrifice is impossible anyhow. [It may not be true, but it still might be the most useful belief to have.](https://brianlui.dog/2018/03/20/useful-models-are-better-than-correct-models/) Of course, be very careful before you do this, since the potential downsides can be drastic.
