*Endure Aggro is a powerful deck with a unique playstyle that isn't popular on the ladder. It combines a synergistic and explosive early game with a massive and satisfying finisher. This guide will explain the deck on a conceptual level and prepare you to use it with resounding success on the ladder.*

### Who am I?

I started playing Runeterra in mid December 2020 and Endure Aggro was one of the first decks I crafted. I used Endure Aggro during my pushes from plat 1 to diamond 4 and from diamond 1 to masters, so I've used the deck a lot and seen success with it at mid level, even though I'm a newer player at the game as a whole. I took this list in particular from Swim's website (link), but it's not the current version that he has up there. I think this version is better though, after playing both lists.

### What is Endure Aggro and why should I play it?

Endure Aggro takes advantage of SI's "kill your own units" package (Ravenous Butcher, Cursed Keeper, Barkbeast, etc.) to set up extremely powerful openings while They Who Endure, a Freljord 7-drop, forms the core of the lategame. They Who Endure is a 1/1 overwhelm unit that gains +1/+1 for every friendly unit that has died, meaning the unit sacrifice went on in the early-mid game can lead to a very high power overwhelm attack (or Atrocity) to finish opponents off.

Here are its advantages:

- easy to play
- fast games
- no one has experience in the matchup since it's so underplayed
- beats aggro decks
- beats Ezreal Draven
- cheap to craft

Here is its weakness:

- its finisher is hard countered by "Hush"

I took this decklist from Swim's website (link), but it's not the current version of Endure Aggro that he's featuring, and I think this version is better than the one he's featuring.

### How do I win games with the deck?

There are two primary strategies for winning with the deck. Try for a busted opener, but you may have to play more defensively for the combo depending on your hand.

Plan A: Nut draw and blow them out turns 1-2
These days deck after deck doesn't run good one and two drops, because they all want to bank the spell mana instead. But Endure Aggro runs the most explosive 1 and 2 drops in the game, so you can sneak in a massive board advantage and do loads of nexus damage before your opponent can respond. Specifically, these four units will allow you to explode on most decks if you can draw the right combinations of them.

Pesky Specter
Barkbeast
Ravenous Butcher
Cursed Keeper

The openings you should be aiming for are:
Barkbeast -> Specter (4 damage and a 3/3 on turn 1, good)
Barkbeast -> Specter -> Butcher (6 damage, a 3/2, and a 3/3 on turn 1, great)
Keeper -> Butcher (7 damage, a 4/3, and a 3/2 on turn 2, good)
Barkbeast -> Keeper -> Butcher (10 damage, a 4/3, 3/2, and 3/3 on turn 2, great)
Specter -> Butcher (3 damage and a 3/2 on turn one, relatively bad but sometimes ya gotta)

You should mulligan aggressively for the first four of these openings. Besides these cards, you should also be looking out for Elise, since she's the best two drop that doesn't require a two-card combo (I usually keep Elise unless I already have something nuts to do on turn 2). You should not be hesitant to develop instead of open attacking on turns 2 and 3, since you can usually get more presence than other decks with your mana on those turns.

After you've done this opening, if you don't kill them all the way just by using the wideness of your board to force damage, you have a few ways to finish things off. You can drop Kalista, level her, and grind your opponent out on the board (but sometimes she's better used as just another body in a wide board). You can drop Blighted Caretaker which will widen your board by two at least and challenge two opposing blockers, letting you shove damage more effectively. Or you can, on turns 5-6, (open) attack with a wide board and Battle Rage (+8/+4) whoever they don't block to effectively force 8 more burn. If that doesn't work, try plan B.

Plan B: Chump block a ton and win with They Who Endure
The other thing that this deck has is tons of small bodies (called "chump blockers") to keep your nexus safe. Your 1-2 drops as mentioned above can contest most aggro decks by blocking starting very early and thus freezing out most hyper aggro openers. This also works in the later game vs most decks that don't have elusive or overwhelm to get around them, meaning that as long as you don't care that you're slowly losing the board you can keep your nexus very safe. Because this strategy can drastically slow down the rate at which you lose nexus health while also killing off tons of your own units, you can play "They Who Endure" after stalling this way and then close the game with it (and Atrocity if needed).

You should not hesitate to play "linear combinations" of these two strategies, by the way. No need to stick to extremes. If you can make plays from both sides then that's even stronger.

### Tips and tricks:

Glimpse Beyond can be used to dodge "combo centric" wincons Fiora and Lee Sin if you kill off the ally that they're challenging. This is useful when it's time to stall.

Stalking Shadows is the only burst speed spell in the deck, and it's also one of the only spells in the deck, period. As such, you should often save it to combo-enable Barkbeast, which can otherwise get stranded. Ignore this as needed.

If you have 4 units, you can get full value off of Blighted Caretakeraretaker by killing a no-deathrattle minion (so not Cursed Keeper or Hapless Aristocrat). If you have 3 units you can kill a Keeper or Aristocrat instead. Sometimes you should break your keeper even if you have 4 units, but you should be thinking ahead if you plan to cast caretaker so that you don't get put in this position if you don't want to.

It's right to attack with Kalista and Barkbeast last in line, since they can increase their power if things die. This is important for Specter -> Barkbeast opener.

13 mana is how much you need to play They Who Endure and Atrocity on one turn, and it's also how much you can have on turn 10 and after if you bank 3 spell mana.

### Thanks for reading!

I hope you learned something from this guide. I've had a lot of fun with this deck as it's carried me up the ladder, and this is also something I wish for you.

### Appendix: Flex slots

Let's look at some of the worst cards in the deck and the best cards not in the deck. Can they be exchanged for one another to improve the deck? I don't think so, and here's why.

Vile Feast:
I run two Vile Feast because the card is very good at beating Zoe and Teemo, and can also remove a Valor or Miss Fortune (the latter with some help from Blighted Caretaker). This deck benefits a lot from having spells since it has so few way to spend its spell mana in many cases. Also, if you're "hardcore" and you don't draw glimpse, Butcher, or Caretaker, you can use this to slaughter your own Cursed Keeper.

Notably I run Vile Feast instead of Unspeakable Horror because this deck is already pretty bad at enabling nightfall. If a card is mostly used for early game tempo swings or removing a small unit that's open attacking me, the last thing I want is for it to suck if it's the first card played in a turn.

Hapless Aristocrat:
Some lists run three of them, some lists run zero. This list runs one. It has two bodies so it's a good target to be sacrificed, and with the Vile Feasts, leveling Elise becomes a significant possibility especially if you draw Elise's Crawling Sensation.

Warden's Prey
Another chump with an upside. This one's upside requires extra mana to use, though. In a slower variant of this style that's fine, but in this version turns 1-3 are premium and we are already extremely strapped for mana on those turns, so I prefer a spiderling on board to a cheap last breath follower in hand.

Pesky Specter
Some people don't run this card. If you look at my "Plan A" section, you can understand that I think this is totally crazy and that it disables like half of your good aggro openings. Easy 3-of.

Battle Rage
This card has convinced me of its place as a second finisher. You almost always have a wider board than your opponents, and you almost always want to push damage. Battle Rage lets you convert unblocked units into big damage. Battle Rage after open attacking on turns 5-6 wins games. Like They Who Endure, it gets countered by Hush, but that's one less Hush they have at their disposal. Some people would say that this card is a "flex slot" but I just think it's a "flex". Ha ha.

Wraithcaller
This is a higher-end guy you can run. It's great value, two bodies, and it can be very strong if you levelup Kalista and then summon it over and over again. But it's worse if you run Battle Rage because it needs allegiance, and it's also a card that gets better the more of it you run. I am not sure about this card.

Splinter Soul
This card can let you duplicate your They Who Endure for three spell mana on the turn you play it. That can turn lost games into won games if you need the extra damage, but it's generally worse than Atrocity.

Shroud of Darkness
You've never heard of this card and that's cause it's probably bad. It's a 1-cost burst spell that gives your next summoned unit +1/+0 and spellshield. Hush, Vengeance, and other bullshit can wreck your They Who Endure with one card, but this wrecks those cards with one card. Useless in most matchups and outside of the lategame, but if you're wading through an ocean of Targon (sometimes the ladder be like that), then you can tech this in to rub it in their face. But if you're in an ocean of Targon you should probably be playing another deck. Also can work as a combo enabler.

Elise
Some people don't run her. Insanity. She's better than Kalista. Two or more bodies, one of which can force damage with fearsome? That's amazing. Also, some people don't run Kalista. Those people are crazy too, but they're right in that unleveled Kalista isn't great.
