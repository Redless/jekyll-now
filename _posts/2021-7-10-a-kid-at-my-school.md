*Portrait of a very unique young man I once knew.*

I went to a high school with a kid named Will. He always stuck out like a sore thumb because of how he dressed. He wore a big trenchcoat that seemed like it was from an era past. It was a very intentional clothing choice and yet one that betrayed very little knowledge of (or care for?) the conventional styles of the day.

Another strange thing about Will was his katana. He must've saved up for years to buy it. He brought it to school once but he wasn't allowed to after that. I think that he wore it across his back whenever he wasn't at school though. He certainly practiced with it and he posted bizarre videos on facebook of him swinging it around, wearing his trenchcoat.

I talked to him a few times just randomly, and he told me that he wielded the katana in order to protect his friends. He said that he'd always stand up to people who tried to hurt them, even if he was gravely injured or his life was in danger. His personality was really gruff and blunt, and he didn't have much time for politeness, instead seeming to focus on things more important to him.

Whenever something went slightly awry, like an eraser going missing or something like that, Will would want to hear all about it and he'd be on the case. He had a strong sense of justice and he loved to try to get to the bottom of foul play, in his own way. He thought of himself as a detective or prosecutor of some sort, I think.

As you might imagine, Will didn't have much success with the ladies. For a while he was constantly making reference to some girl I'd never heard of, called "Diana". We'd be about to leave school and he'd say something like "I can't wait to get home to Diana". I just assumed that she was a girlfriend or something that went to another school, but one day someone asked him about it and after a few minutes of going back and forth it came out that Diana was actually his cat, and he didn't have a girlfriend after all.
